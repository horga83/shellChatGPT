## Getting Started

### Required packages

- Free [OpenAI GPTChat key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Ksh, Bash or Zsh
- cURL
- JQ (optional)
- Imagemagick (optional)
- Base64 (optional)


### Installation

Just download the stand-alone `chatgpt.sh` and make it executable or clone this repo.


## Environment

- Set `$OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key.
- Set `$CHATGPTRC` with path to the configuration file. Defaults = `~/.chatgptsh.conf`.


## Usage

- Set your OpenAI API key with option `-k [KEY]` or environment variable `$OPENAI_KEY`
- Just write your prompt after the script name `chatgpt.sh`
- Chat mode may be configured with Instructions or not.
- Set temperature value with `-t [VAL]` (0.0 to 2.0), defaults=0.
- To set your model, run `chatgpt.sh -l` and then set option `-m [MODEL_NAME]`
- Some models require a \`prompt' while others \`instructions' and \`input'
- To generate images, set option -i and write your prompt
- Make a variation of an image, set -i and an image path for upload

## Examples

Single text completion:

    chatgpt.sh "Hello there! What is your name?"

Text completion with Curie model:

    chatgpt.sh -mtext-curie-001 "Hello there! What is your name?"
    chatgpt.sh -m1 "Hello there! What is your name?"

Chat completion, sets temperature:

    chatgpt.sh -cc -t0.7 "Hello there! What is your name?"

Text completion chat mode, use visual editor instead of shell `read` or `vared`:

    chatgpt.sh -cx -t0.7 "Hello there! What is your name?"

Use the \`edits' endpoint, this option requires two or more prompts,
instructions (required) and the proper (optional):

    chatgpt.sh -e "Fix spelling mistakes" "This promptr has spilling mistakes."
    chatgpt.sh -e "Shell code to move files to trash bin." ""

Generate image according to prompt:

    chatgpt.sh -i "Dark tower in the middle of a field of red roses."
    chatgpt.sh -i "512x512" "A tower."

Generate image variation:

    chatgpt.sh -i path/to/image.png

Generate transcription from audio file:

    chatgpt.sh -w path/to/audio.mp3
    chatgpt.sh -w path/to/audio.mp3 "en" "This is a poem about X."

Below is a copy of it.


### NAME

    chatgpt.sh -- ChatGPT/DALL-E Shell Wrapper


### SYNOPSIS

    chatgpt.sh [-m [MODEL_NAME|NUMBER]] [opt] [PROMPT]
	chatgpt.sh [-m [MODEL_NAME|NUMBER]] [opt] [INSTRUCTIONS] [INPUT]
	chatgpt.sh -e [opt] [INSTRUCTIONS] [INPUT]
	chatgpt.sh -i [opt] [S|M|L] [PROMPT]
	chatgpt.sh -i [opt] [S|M|L] [INPUT_PNG_PATH]
	chatgpt.sh -l [MODEL_NAME]
	chatgpt.sh -w [opt] [AUDIO_FILE] [LANG] [PROMPT]


All positional arguments are read as a single PROMPT. If the
chosen model requires an INTRUCTION and INPUT prompts, first
positional argument is taken as INSTRUCTIONS and the following
ones as INPUT or PROMPT.

Set `option -c` to start the chatbot via the text completion
endpoint and record the conversation. This option accepts various
models, defaults to `text-davinci-003` if none set.

Set `option -cc` to start the chatbot via the chat endpoint,
currenly only models are `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301`.

Set `option -C` (with `-cc`) to resume from last history session.

`Option -e` sets the \`edits' endpoint. That endpoint requires
both INSTRUCTIONS and INPUT prompts. This option requires
setting an \`edits model'.

`Option -i` generates images according to PROMPT. If first
positional argument is a picture file, then generate variation
of it. A size of output image may se set, such as S, M or L.

`Option -w` transcribes audio from mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav,
and webm files. First positional argument must be an audio file.
Optionally, set a two letter input language (ISO-639-1) as second
argument. A prompt may also be set after language (must be in the
same language as the audio).

Stdin is supported when there is no positional arguments left
after option parsing. Stdin input sets a single PROMPT.

User configuration is kept at `~/.chatgpt.conf`.
Script cache is kept at `~/.cache/chatgptsh/`.

A personal (free) OpenAI API is required, set it with -k or
see ENVIRONMENT section.

For the skill list, see <https://platform.openai.com/examples>.

For complete model and settings information, refer to OPENAI
API docs at <https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides>.


### COMPLETIONS

Given a prompt, the model will return one or more predicted
completions. It can be used a chatbot.

Set `option -c` to enter text completion chat and keep a history
of the conversation and works with a variety of models.

Set `option -cc` to use the chat completion endpoint. Works the
same as the text completion chat, however the only available
models are `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301`.

The defaults chat format is `Q & A`. A name such as \`NAME:'
may be introduced as interlocutor. Setting only \`:' works as
an instruction prompt or to complete the previous answer prompt.

While in chat mode, type in one of the following commands, and
a value in the new prompt (e.g. \`!temp0.7', \`!mod1'):

	!NUM |  !max 	  Set maximum tokens.
	-a   |  !pre 	  Set presence.
	-A   |  !freq 	  Set frequency.
	-c   |  !new 	  Starts new session.
	-H   |  !hist 	  Edit history file.
	-m   |  !mod 	  Set model by index number.
	-p   |  !top 	  Set top_p.
	-t   |  !temp 	  Set temperature.
	-v   |  !ver	  Set/unset verbose.
	-x   |  !ed 	  Set/unset text editor.
	!q   |  !quit	  Exit.


#### Prompt Design

Make a good prompt. May use bullets for multiple questions in
a single prompt. Write \`act as [technician]', add examples of
expected results.

For the chatbot, the only initial indication given is a \`Q: '
interlocutor flag. Without previous instructions, the first
replies may return lax but should stabilise on further promtps.

Alternatively, one may try setting initial instructions prompt
with the bot identity and how it should behave as, such as:

	prompt>	\": The following is a conversation with an AI
		  assistant. The assistant is helpful, creative,
		  clever, and friendly.\"

	reply_> \"A: Hello! How can I help you?\"

	prompt> \"Q: Hello, what is your name?\"

Also see section ENVIRONMENT to set defaults chatbot instructions.

For details on settings, see <https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides>.


### EDITS

This endpoint is set with models with \`edit' in their name
or option -e.

Editing works by specifying existing text as a prompt and an
instruction on how to modify it. The edits endpoint can be used
to change the tone or structure of text, or make targeted changes
like fixing spelling. Weâ€™ve also observed edits to work well on
empty prompts, thus enabling text generation similar to the
completions endpoint. 


### IMAGES / DALL-E

The first positional parameter sets the output image size
256x256/small, 512x512/medium or 1024x1024/large. Defaults=512x512.

An image can be created given a prompt. A text description of
the desired image(s). The maximum length is 1000 characters.

Also, a variation of a given image can be generated. The image
to use as the basis for the variation(s). Must be a valid PNG
file, less than 4MB and square. If Imagemagick is available,
input image will be converted to square before upload.


### AUDIO / WHISPER
Transcribes audio into the input language. May set a two letter
ISO-639-1 language as the second positional parameter. A prompt
may also be set after language to help the model.
	
Setting temperature has an effect. Currently, only one audio model
is available.


### ENVIRONMENT
	
    CHATGPTRC 	Path to user chatgpt.sh configuration.
			Defaults=~/.chatgpt.conf

	CHATINSTR 	Initial instruction set for the chatbot.

	OPENAI_API_KEY
	OPENAI_KEY 	Set your personal (free) OpenAI API key.

	VISUAL
	EDITOR 		Text editor for external prompt editing.
			Defaults=vim


### LIMITS
	
For most models this is 2048 tokens, or about 1500 words).
Davici model limit is 4000 tokens (~3000 words) and for
gpt-3.5-turbo models it is 4096 tokens.

### BUGS

Certain PROMPTS may return empty responses. Maybe the model
has nothing to add to the input prompt or it expects more text.
Try trimming spaces, appending a full stop/ellipsis, or
resetting temperature or adding more text. See prompt design.

Language models are but a mirror of human written records, they
do not \`understand' your questions or \`know' the answers to it.
Garbage in, garbage out.
